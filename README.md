# DarkThemeMario-Practice
I developed this game for practical purposes, and it has also improved my Unity skills. Although the mechanics of the game may resemble Mario to some extent, its distinctiveness is quite evident. While the game is currently in its simplest form, it has been left open for further development and will be shared as it evolves.
