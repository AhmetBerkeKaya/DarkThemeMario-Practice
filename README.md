# Project Name
- Game Link : https://ahmetberkekaya.itch.io/mario-but-dark-theme
This project is a Unity-based game developed for practical purposes. While the game mechanics may resemble those of Mario, it has its own distinctive features. The game, in its current basic form, has been left open for further development and will be shared as it evolves.

## Story

The game features a storyline, although not explicitly mentioned at its current state. It revolves around a mustached character facing creatures from his imagination, creating a conflict. As the story is yet to be fully developed, the ending may change, but currently, it appears as follows: The mustached character embarks on a journey to overcome his fears without having anything to lose while defeating the creatures he fears. In the end, he believes that he has conquered his fears after his grand adventure. Additionally, the game offers three different atmospheres, including small traps, challenging courses, and a formidable end-game boss.
